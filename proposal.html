    <h1>NBA Stats Project Proposal</h1>
    <section>
        <h2>Problem Description</h2>
        <p>
            Nowadays, where technology and advances in computing power thrive, 
            accessing the desired information is easier than ever. However, 
            sometimes overwhelming information might result in confusion or inefficiency in decision making; 
            in modern settings where results need to be delivered quickly, precision, accuracy, 
            and optimization are the utmost critical elements for success.
        </p>
        <p>
            The NBA statistical data provides insights into a player's guards, forwards, centers, 
            points scored, etc. People utilize this information to make a living by 
            predicting the results and outcome of matches. However, with more than 4,500 players in the NBA, 
            the time consumption for an accurate prediction is extensive. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Although many sites on the web provide the NBA's statistical data, such as ESPN, 
            and sites that offer insights into matches, such as pickswise, they are not sufficient. 
            There is no tool that can efficiently customize games and compare players' statistics 
            in the simulated game. 
        </p>

        <h2>Proposed Application</h2>
        <p>
            The users of this application would be fantasy basketball players and the sports betting community. 
            In addition, scouts can also use our application for some comparison functions. 
            The information the users would be viewing are the real life stats of each NBA player, 
            and I will be using a real life nba stats api to keep our stats updated, 
            and these are the links to the external source: 
            <a href="https://pypi.org/project/nba-api/">API</a> &
            <a href="https://www.lineups.com/nba/player-stats">Example</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            <ul> Iteractions our application would have:
                <li>filters playerâ€™s data to show only guards, forwards, or center</li>
                <li>
                    sorts players with different stats in order, 
                    such as showing players who have the most points per game on the top of the page
                </li>
                <li>
                    a trading comparison tool using a bar graph for fantasy players where it shows 
                    which categories the user is gaining and losing with the players the user selects to trade
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            Our problem, which is not having an effective tool for the NBA statistical analysis and 
            comparison can be solved via the web application we are developing that aims for fully 
            customized simulated match results.
